# Next.js vs. Gatsby vs. Create React App

![Next.js Trend](/images/nextjs-gatsby-create-react-app/banner.jpg)

It's never been a <Link slug="learn-next-js" title="Why Should You Learn Next.js?" >better time</Link>
to learn React. If you're just getting started, you might have heard about these three options:

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
-   [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
-   [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/)

However, it's not exactly clear when or why you would choose one over the other.
This post will highlight the key similarities and differences between the three solutions.

## Next.js

Next.js is a framework for building **server-rendered** React applications.
Server-rendering provides a variety of [benefits](https://nextjs.org/features/server-side-rendering), including faster page load times and improved SEO.

Building server-side rendering yourself is difficult, which is one of the many reasons people turn to Next.js.
If you had previously heard of Next but haven't checked it out in a while, I would _highly_ recommend revisiting it.

**Pros**

-   ✅ Server-side rendering out of the box
-   ✅ Support for full applications, as well as static sites
-   ✅ Built-in TypeScript support
-   ✅ Incredible developer experience

**Cons**

-   ⛔️ Framework-specific knowledge (`_app.js`, `_document.js`)
-   ⛔️ No plugin system ([yet](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/9133))
-   ⛔️ Added complexity with server-rendering

## Gatsby

The key difference between Next.js and Gatsby is that Gatsby doesn't use a server.
While Gatsby's main use case is for static sites, it can also re-hydrate into a fully-functional React application.
Many other Next.js vs. Gatsby comparisons miss the fact that Next.js can also be used as a static site generator.

Gatsby comes bundled with GraphQL for data fetching. Here's a short example.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {graphql} from 'gatsby';

const HomePage = ({data}) => {
    return <div>{data.site.siteMetadata.description}</div>;
};

export const query = graphql`
    query HomePageQuery {
        site {
            siteMetadata {
                description
            }
        }
    }
`;

export default HomePage;
```

You can use [Gatsby without GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/using-gatsby-without-graphql/) if you absolutely must/want, but it's one of the key features it promotes.

**Pros**

-   ✅ Robust [plugin library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)
-   ✅ GraphQL integration
-   ✅ Well-written documentation & tutorials

**Cons**

-   ⛔️ GraphQL knowledge potentially needed
-   ⛔️ Potentially large build times (e.g. lots of images/fetches)

## Create React App

CRA helps you get started building React apps immediately with client-side rendering (CSR). There's much less to digest and understand.
Unfortunately, that also means there's less you get for free as you scale your application.

**Pros**

-   ✅ Easiest to learn (no extra framework)
-   ✅ Created & maintained by React team
-   ✅ Built-in TypeScript support

**Cons**

-   ⛔️ No server-side rendering
-   ⛔️ No code-splitting out of the box ([can be configured](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/code-splitting/))
-   ⛔️ Requires client-side routing library (e.g. React Router)
-   ⛔️ "Ejecting" for custom use cases can add complexity

## Conclusion

Still not sure which one to choose? I would highly recommend reading [Rendering on the Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web) for a deep-dive on where your rendering logic should live.
